`.editorconfig` has basic settings for things like indenting, etc. This can be used in any modern text editor, although some (_cough_ VS Code) need plugins.

### If using VS Code:

- Install the [Blender Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development) for code hinting and more
- Install the [EditorConfig extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) to use `.editorconfig` settings

### Roadmap:

See [Future Enhancements](README.md#future-enhancements) in the Readme for high priority features and enhancements that the community has requested.
